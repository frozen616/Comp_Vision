This is where I have kept the useful code that I have created for my journey of learning Computer Vision and Deep Learning. 

Mask_RCNN - This folder contains a great example of a Mask_RCNN. 

homework - Contains homework assignments that could be useful for future coding projects

useful_functions - Contains functions that can be used for computer vision projects

basic_plot is kept here to have a quick reference for plotting
