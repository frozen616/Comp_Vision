CV_OpenCV_Tyler_Angus.ipynb - This is my first homework assigment that shows examples of morphological operations such as erosion and dialation.

The above image is the original image after a erosion

Dilation:

CV_FaceDection_Tyler_Angus.ipynb - This is another assignment that makes an attempt at face detection and tries to find obama in a dataset of faces.
This code is a decent reference when working with multi nested dictionaries. It uses template matching methods and analyzes how well they work. 
The predictions are poor and the code could use improvement but it does compile and attempts to do facial recognition.

CV_Concept_Neural_Network_Tyler_Angus.ipynb - This code is short and simple and is a way of showing how activation functions work within Neural Networks.

CV_CNN_Classifier_Tyler_Angus.ipynb - This code is a full build of a Convolution Nueral Network. 
This code uses the MNIST data set and build a model trains the model and does different analysis to figure out what gives you more accurate results when detecting letters. 
The model can predict written letter to an accuraccy of over 98%.'

Angus_Tyler_Histogram_matching.ipynb - This code analizes the different features of histogram matching. It uses 'coerrelation', 'chi-squared', 'Intersection', and 'Hellinger'.
